# Graphics Engine for browser

## Project 1 for Laboratory of Graphic Aplications class at FEUP.

In this project we made a webGL javascprit based graphics engine which reads a scene specification in the format of dsx language (xml based) stores its information in a graph and it's then loaded onto the browser using a teacher made library ([WebCGF](https://paginas.fe.up.pt/~ruirodrig/pub/sw/webcgf/docs/#)) as a mediator for webGL.
