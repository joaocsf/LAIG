# Graphics Engine for browser

### Final Project for Laboratory of Graphic Aplications class at FEUP.

Now that we have a functional graphics engine that has some primitives aswell as animations, the goal is to create a user interface for the game that the group implemented using the language _Prolog_ for the Logic Programming class. (You can find that project [here](https://github.com/PeaceOff/PLOG)).
